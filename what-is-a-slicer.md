# What is a Slicer

A slicer is a distributor of ERC-1165 tokens called slices, which are tied to a Safe. Slices enable the holders to claim a percentage of the safe's value relative to other slice holders. For instance, if a contributor holds 20% of the slices, they can claim 20% of the safe's value.
