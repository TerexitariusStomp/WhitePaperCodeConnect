# Merge Pull Request

Merged pull requests can also be rewarded, no matter if the contributor is existing or new. Upon merging a pull request, contributors can use the request command. They can also use the request command for other contributors by knowing their wallet address. This time, instead of sending each contributor one slice, the wallet addresses are added to a snapshot. All slice holders can then vote on the value of the contributions.
