# Adding the App to A Repo

Anyone can push our codebase (based on [Merge to Earn](https://mte.slice.so/)) into a projects repository. When this push is done, the contributors of the repository receive a notification through Github's messaging system. The contributors of the repository then choose to accept the application as an addition to the repository or not.&#x20;
