# Registering Contributors

If the project is accepted as an addition to the repository, the contributors are then requested to each individually add their cryptocurrency wallet address. Depending on the repository, some contributors may not be web3 native. So time is needed for them to set up their wallet. After the set time, all contributors would be registered with their wallet address.&#x20;
