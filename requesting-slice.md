# Requesting Slice

When checking the newly added repo, contributors notice a new issue is created. Contributors request a slice by following the instructions within the issue. A request is made including their wallet address. A Github bot reacts with a thumbs up if the request is eligible. After all requests are made, the issue is closed and the Github bot sends the request to the Safe.
