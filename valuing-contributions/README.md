# Valuing Contributions

Once a time has elapsed for the contributors to each add their wallet addresses, a vote occurs. This vote determines how many tokens, called slices, are distributed to each contributor. The vote is only able to be voted upon by the contributors with registered wallet addresses. After the vote occurs, the slices are sent to each contributor of the repository from the Safe.&#x20;
