# Valuing Contributions

The distribute command creates a snapshot vote for the contributor's request. Contributors holding slices then vote on each contributor's percentage of contribution on the Snapshot. After finalizing the results, the person that pushed the MTE repo, merges the awarded slices on the Github repository using a command. The merge command is sent to the Safe for transaction confirmation and slices are distributed to contributors based on the finalized results.

In the future UMA’s oSnap Protocol would be integrated here to automate the slice token distribution after the Snapshots vote finalizes. However UMA’s oSnap is not on Base network yet.
