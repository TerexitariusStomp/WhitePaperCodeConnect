# Safe Module

Instead of the organizer having to approve the request, once the first contributor's wallet address is known they can be set as a delegate to the safe for the code connect application through the use of a Safe module. This means that the contributor can now confirm transactions on the safe for the Code Connect application without the organizer needing to approve it.
